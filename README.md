# Explainable Transformer Chatbot

##  Demo
Check out a working demo here: [Explainable Transformer Chatbot Streamlit App](https://explainable-transformer-chatbot.streamlit.app/)

##  Summary
An interactive chatbot powered by a Transformer model, enhanced with **explainability features**. It not only answers user queries but also demonstrates its inner workings—like tokenization, attention heatmaps, and token probability distributions—via a sleek Streamlit UI.

##  Objective
To merge practical chatbot functionality with interpretability, showcasing both the application and the underlying mechanisms of language models in an accessible way.

##  Tech Stack
- Python  
- Hugging Face Transformers  
- PyTorch  
- Streamlit (frontend UI)  
- Matplotlib / Plotly for visualizations  

##  Applications
- Transparent AI-powered chat systems (e.g., FAQs with insight)  
- Educational tool for teaching how LLMs think  
- Research and explainability dashboards for NLP  

##  Future Use
- Fine-tune on domain-specific datasets (e.g., legal, medical)  
- Support for larger or more specialized LLMs  
- Deploy as a live cloud service for explainable chatbot solutions
